# Project 3

## Purpose:
The purpose of the project was to create and test multiple coin module functions. Then, create an index file to display the functions on a barebones web page. With each function, I created a route that could be used with GET.

## Technologies Learned:
```markdown
- Fastify
- GET commands
- Git
- nodemon
- Non-web server Node.js
```
## What I learned:
This project introduced us to the creation of servers using fastify, and creating different routes on the given server. Importing web server code, and utilizing an index.html, we were able to output each function on their respective GET route.
